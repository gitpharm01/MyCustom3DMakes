	<h3>I started my journey on 3D printing at early 2019 with a cheap delta printer. <br>
	<img src=./imgs/myPrinter01.png height=150px></img>
From then on, I was again and agina amazed by the aboutdant support and resources released from the 3D printing communities around the world.<br> 
Many people generously shared their genius designs for free on platforms like Thingiverse.com. <br>
Since I'm lucky enough to have both 3D modeling and programming capabilities, the OPENjscad became very attractive to me.
The jscad does not require any software installation and significantly reduces the internet traffic needed to transfer one design since each design is contained in a small script file. <br>
I wish to show its severly undervalued power to the 3D printing communities and maybe I can make something even more awesome to happen in the future.</h3>
